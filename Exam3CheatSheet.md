##Neural Nets

###Useful Information
1) Neural Nets are numerical classifiers with binary (`0/1`) output
2) The neuron is a primitive circuit element
3) Forward propagation computes the overall output of a neural net

(Input Layer) -> (Logic Function Layers) -> Output (`0/1`)

A single neuron can draw one line and shade above or below it

###Primitive Logic Functions Computable by a Single Neuron

- `AND(x,y)`

- `OR(x,y)`

- `NOT(x, _)`
